<!-- 
  
bjective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.


UNFULFILLED STORIES:

User Story #2: I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.

User Story #6: I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".



User Story #13: The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

User Story #14: My product landing page should have at least one media query.

User Story #15: My product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once.

You can build your project by forking this CodePen pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: 

Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.-->
